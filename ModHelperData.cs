This is for sake of time, and also making the mod easier to modify. \nFor info on how to use these templates check out the wiki on github! (You can get to github by pressing the home button)\n\n Any and all bugs get reported to me directly on discord (dm, my discord server or btd6 mod helper discord) or on github";
